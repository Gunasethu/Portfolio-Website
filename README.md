## About Website

Learned HTML and CSS basics. To test and pracise them I've created a simple Portfolio website

- Used some SVG's.
- It's an responsive website
- Tried Neumorphic style for the about div for the first time and it came quite well I guess.

*Thanks folks for taking time and seeing my website!*
